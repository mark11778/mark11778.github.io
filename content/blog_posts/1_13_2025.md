# 1/13/2025 - Happy New Year! :)

Ok so the first problem with this cite is being handled, that being that I don't have any money so I need to make all the html files static so they can be hosted on github pages ... with that being said I also have a server that I use to host a website but because this one is simpler than that one I am going to just work on making this one static. Which I think I can do via a CI pipeline to automate all of the process.
